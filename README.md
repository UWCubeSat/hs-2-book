# hs-2-book
Informational book about HuskySat-2

NOTE: This is just an experiment/work in progress.

## Goals
This book can be used as a middle-ground between the highly-technical academic papers written at HS-2, and the simplified marketing-content. Other CubeSat teams can read this book to learn how the technology of HS-2 works at a high-level.

## Technial

[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is a static-site-generator that converts markdown to html+css. Benefits
- Netlify supports automatic build and publishing. (to make our book public, eventually, maybe)
- Easy to create organized technical descriptions of each subsystem, with images, graphs, links to papers, and simple navigation.
