# hs-2-book
Informational book about [HuskySat-2](https://huskysat.org/missions#huskysat-2)

NOTE: This is merely an experiment/work in progress. It is currently inaccurate and incomplete.

## Goals

This book can be used as a middle-ground between the highly-technical academic papers written at HS-2, and the simplified marketing-content. Other CubeSat teams can read this book to learn how the technology of HS-2 works at a high-level.

## Technical

This book uses mdBook, a static-site-generator that converts markdown to html+css.

Follow [mdBook's installation guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation) to serves the book locally.

### Benefits of mdBook

- Netlify supports automatic builds and publishing. (to make our book public, eventually, maybe)
- Easy to create organized technical descriptions of each subsystem, with images, graphs, links to papers, etc.
- Built-in search and navigation.
- Very little setup and configuration.
